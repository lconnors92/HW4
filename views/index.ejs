                <p><b>Overview of Automation</b></p>
                <p>Automation in IT means taking the blood, sweat, and tears out of tasks that administrators must 
                    laboriously repeat monthly, weekly, daily, and perhaps worse--a few times a day or more. These tasks 
                    include checking system status, creating user accounts, gathering reports, adding users to permissions 
                    groups, and more. Automating a process saves time, reduces mistakes, and makes it easier to manage an 
                    army of machines or cloud services across an enterprise or home network. Click below to learn more!</p>

                    <p><b>What is PowerShell?</b></p>
                <p>PowerShell is Microsoft's command-line and scripting tool made for administrators. It can run single commands, but it can also run full scripts. A big advantage of PowerShell is that it works with objects (not just text), so admins can filter and format data very easily. Click below to learn more!</p>

                <p><b>What is an API?</b></p>
                <p>An API (Application Programming Interface) is a way for one piece of software to talk to another. Many modern services such as Microsoft 365, cloud backups, device management tools, and HR systems expose web APIs so other programs or scripts can read or update data automatically.

                <p><b>Why They Are a Powerful Duo</b></p>
                <p>When an administrator combines PowerShell with APIs, they can automate across a network. A script can log into a cloud service, pull user information, compare it to Active Directory, and then make changes without risking the mistakes or sadness of the administrator.</p>
